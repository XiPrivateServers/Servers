# Server Information

#### Basic Information
- LV cap: currently 75, with 2/3 ratio on subjobs and monsters boosted. No level cap changes will happen prior to adding WotG.
- Certain balance adjustments have been made to allow non standard job combination to be viable. (**NOT YOU** war/whm, you still suck)
- Play style goal: allow small groups of friends to clear everything, no alliances required.
- Basic EXP rate is 2.5x (book exp excluded from this amount, and receives a smaller bonus)
- Increased chain bonus leading up to 5x exp bonus for sustained chains. Chain time also enhanced.
- Additional weekend EXP bonus on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
- Base movement speed is basically perma flee. All speed boosts (including flee, chocobos etc.) are _even faster_
- Advanced Jobs must still be quested, but subjobs start unlocked and the quest auto completed.
- Many items have had bonus effects and hidden latent effects added so lots of formerly useless pieces of gear have been powered up.
- Custom NMs, custom exp mobs, custom farming mobs, custom H.E.L.M. additions, augmented treasures and more.
- Hardcore Mode for people who prefer a more challenging game experience.<br>Certain custom content is Hardcore Mode specific.<br>Note: In Hardcore Mode, EXP rate is 1x

#### Auction House:
- No fees at all for now.
- Listing expiration disabled.
- 252 AH slots and you can see them all in game. Yes really.
- Bot with custom stock list, priced for crafters and farmers players to undercut it
- Bot does not purchase from players, only supplies items players are not providing.
- Bot items can be changed via our feedback repository as the item list is public.

#### Demiurge is a build-it-as-we-go server, meaning that more expansions will get enabled as sufficient content exists for them.

## Regarding the server name
The Demiurge is in several Greek writings.<br>
In some, it is a mindless force of creation - just building because its what it does and can't do anything else.<br>
In others, it is an evil (or sometimes merely ignorant) god that has its creations trapped in the material world.<br>
Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly benevolent, and so it desires a world as good as possible.<br>
The world remains imperfect, however, because the Demiurge created the world out of a chaotic, indeterminate non-being.

##### _Teo cannot help but build things. It is the nature of Teo to keep making things.<br>We are trapped in the inability to permanently give up this game.<br>Teo is (allegedly) benevolent but the game is imperfect because it is made using chaotic client side and "PS2 limitations"._
