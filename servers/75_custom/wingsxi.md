# Server Information

75-era server choosing era-accurate content unless deemed too disrespectful to the player's time/sanity.

   - No dual-boxing with an emphasis on ensuring fair play

   - All ToaU missions
   - All Tier 1 Assaults including Nyzul Isle Investigation
   - All ZNMs _including_ Pandemonium Warden
   - WotG missions up to and including "Purple, the New Black" (With an obvious stated goal of getting retail-accurate continuation of the story)
   - Dark Ixion with proper spawn/spook/claim mechanics
   - All three Mini-Expansions fully functional (ACP,AMK,ASA) with repeatable rewards and Nexus Cape
 - Fully open-source, including:
   - A [dynamic data-lookup tool](https://www.wingsxi.com/wangzthangz/index.php)
   - A [custom loader](https://gitlab.com/ffxiwings/wingsloader) and [login server](https://gitlab.com/ffxiwings/wings/-/tree/master/src/new-login) that supports advanced encryption and MFA (and more mog storage in game if MFA is enabled)
   - [A launcher](https://gitlab.com/MowFord/WingsXI-Launcher) to keep addons/plugins/DATs up-to-date with the server experience.
